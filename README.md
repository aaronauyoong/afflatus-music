# Project 3 - Afflatus Music

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Idea - Afflatus Music Blog for Music Lovers
* Connection to Spotify API
* Sharing music you love with other users (kind of like reddit?)
* Create posts, edit, delete posts
* Create, edit, delete comments

## To Do 
* Wireframe
* Initial Pitch

## Description
Afflatus Music is a web application that allows users to create playlists and share them as posts amongst other users. Users can comment on posts and recommend songs to be added to the playlist. This application functions as a mini-Spotify-clone, and links with Spotify’s developer API. 

## Implementation Steps
* Home Page
* Connection to Spotify API (Backend)
* Create User
* Create Posts that has link to Spotify Music

## Packages used
* Spotify-Web-API-Node (New)
* React-Spotify-Web-Playback (New)
* Express
* Bootstrap
* React Bootstrap
* Apollo
* Axios
* Dotenv
* GraphQL
* React Router
* Cors

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
